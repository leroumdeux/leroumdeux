## hey there 👋

i’m alex - a grad student in anglophone studies (Université Bordeaux Montaigne) trying to make academia a lil more ✨ tech-fluent ✨

### what i’m up to rn
- doing researchy things in english/linguistics
- slowly getting into **R** because apparently that’s what linguists do now
- messing around with languages + digital humanities vibes

### languages i mess with
**human:** english • french • romanian • portuguese • spanish • (learning greek)  
**tech:** python • bash • html/css (very baby level but we try)

### random about me
- low-key obsessed with **public transit** (trains > everything, sorry not sorry)
- bikes > cars. trams > chaos.  
- will talk for hours about languages or metro systems if you let me

---

that’s me basically - feel free to poke around 🌿
